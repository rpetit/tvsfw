Implementation of the modified Frank-Wolfe algorithm described in [[1]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.06706). Under active development. See also 
[this repository](https://github.com/rpetit/PyCheeger). *A demo notebook is available in the examples folder*.

Acknowledgments: we thank Robert Tovey for carefuly reviewing this implementation, and for suggesting several modifications that significantly improved its performance.
